                            <p>There are 2 ways to make money on HoneyGain.

                                The first is by installing the app. Currently, there’s only an Android and a Windows app.They’re currently working on an iOS one. For example, if you have an android phone and a Windows laptop like I do, then download it on both of them for twice as many earnings. The other way to earn money is by referring friends. You can invite your friends with your own personalized link and 10% of their daily earnings will be added to your account. If your referral reaches $50 a month you earn an extra $5! You can share your link on Facebook, Twitter, Email, or copying and pasting it anywhere.
                            </p>
